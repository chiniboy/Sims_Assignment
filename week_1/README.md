# Week 1: Rigid Balls, Round Walls

Gravity integration and collision detection for rigid balls bouncing inside a
circular boundary.

**Due: EOD, 7th June 2026.**

## What's in this folder

- [`week1.pdf`](./week1.pdf): the assignment itself. Read it first, it's the
  authority on what the simulation has to do.
- [`main.py`](./main.py): the code template. It opens a window and draws the
  bowl, but none of the physics is there yet. There are two `TODO` blocks in the
  main loop for you to fill in, one for falling and bouncing off the wall, one
  for balls hitting each other. Everything else, the window, the drawing and the
  loop itself, is already wired up.

> Some people complained that the template made them feel like they didn't code it. **You are FREE to use ur own code and not use the template**, just make sure to get the simulation done. Using the template or not won't make a difference. The main thing that matters is the simulation.

## Setup

Open a terminal inside this folder, then run these three, one at a time:

```bash
uv init
uv add pygame numpy
uv run main.py
```

The first sets up the project, the second downloads pygame and numpy, and the
third starts the simulation. It takes a moment the first time around.

After this, only `uv run main.py` is needed.

Don't have uv yet? Install it first. On macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Close the terminal and open a fresh one afterwards.

## What to do

1. Read `week1.pdf`.
2. Fill in the `TODO` blocks in `main.py`.
3. Jot down your answers to **Question 1** and **Question 2** as you go. Keep
   them somewhere in this folder, a text file is fine. You'll need them for your
   submission, and half a page is plenty.

## Accessing positions of the balls.

If you haven't worked with lists much, this is the part worth reading before you
start.

The template keeps the balls in two lists, `positions` and `velocities`. A list
is just an ordered collection of things, and you pull a thing out of it by its
position in the line, counting from zero:

```python
positions[0]    # the first ball
positions[1]    # the second ball
positions[2]    # the third, and so on
```

The two lists line up with each other. Ball number `i` has position
`positions[i]` and velocity `velocities[i]`, so index `0` refers to the same
ball in both.

Right now `NUM_PARTICLES` is `1`, so there is exactly one ball and
`positions[0]` is all you need. No loops required yet.

### Each entry is a pair of numbers

A position isn't a single number, it's an x and a y bundled together in a numpy
array:

```python
positions[0]        # something like [411.8  556.3]
positions[0][0]     # 411.8, the x
positions[0][1]     # 556.3, the y
```

You can work one component at a time if that feels clearer:

```python
positions[0][1] = positions[0][1] + velocities[0][1] * dt
```

Or you can do the maths on both at once, which is the nice thing about numpy
arrays. Adding two of them adds the x's and the y's for you, and multiplying by
a plain number scales both:

```python
positions[0] = positions[0] + velocities[0] * dt
```

Both lines do the same job. The second is shorter and reads closer to the maths
in the PDF.

Two more that will come in handy. Subtracting one position from another gives
you the arrow pointing from the second to the first, and `np.linalg.norm` gives
you the length of an arrow, so together they measure a distance:

```python
offset = positions[0] - BOWL_CENTER              # the arrow from centre to ball
distance = np.linalg.norm(positions[0] - BOWL_CENTER)   # how far out it is
```

### Once there is more than one ball

When you bump `NUM_PARTICLES` up, you'll want to do the same thing to every
ball rather than to `positions[0]` alone. `len(positions)` tells you how many
there are, and a loop walks through them:

```python
for i in range(len(positions)):
    # positions[i] and velocities[i] are the ball being handled this time round
```

For ball-to-ball collisions you need every *pair* of balls, which takes two
loops rather than one. Worth thinking about how to avoid checking the same pair
twice, and how to avoid checking a ball against itself.

Submission details will be announced separately, so don't worry about that part
for now.

BRIEF
We use pygame, numpy and random libraries in this project. I firstly normalized everything to work under meters instead of pixel as I wanted to make it as "realistic" as possible. But turns out real gravity is quite powerful at these small scales. So i had to assume the arena radius is 1m. Now gravity could easily be taken as 9.8 instead weird numbers in the 1000s. 
For all particles the velocity is completely randomised within limits. 
Next, are some functions that try to keep the energy constant. First one finds the total mechanical energy at the beginning using 1/2*v^2 + -g*h for each particle and the next tries to keep that energy constant. 
The restore works because the velocity is always correct as it only gets inverted on collision but the problem comes because the offset changes the height i.e., potential energy. So I change the velocity so that the total energy is not changed but under some tolerance. And it seems to work. 
To have more accuracy, I do all the position, velocity and collision checks 8 times before it is displayed on the screen. 
At the end of everything, I call restore energy to consolidate any discrepancy. And finally everything is drawn on the screen every frame. 
About 100 balls in FINAL.py can be simulated but the major setback i think is the calculation for each collision happening so many times. 
About twice as many balls in BONUS.py because the new method which doesn't check all ball pairs for collisions but only correcting those pairs which do collide is better. 


Q/A
Question 1. A fast enough ball can end up outside the arena without the wall bounce ever being detected. Why does the detection fail, and which of ∆t, |v|, ρ, R and g decide whether it happens?

Answer 1. The detection fails because the large time steps (∆t) are too slow to update and detect the ball going outside the boundary. The speed (|v|) is so high that the ball just fazes through instead of bouncing back. The condition never gets called. 

Question 2. Set ew = 1, so that no energy is lost at a bounce, and let the ball run for a few thousand steps. Does the peak height stay put, creep upward, or decay? Gravity and the bounce rule are the only things acting, so if it changes at all, where is that energy coming from?

Answer 2. Peak height should ideally stay where it is but in practice it decreases. The energy is slowly lost during the many collisions happening with the balls and the walls. So the potential energy is consistently decreasing as a net effect of all the collisions and offsets. Reducing ∆t will make a better approximation.
